Skyperious 3.5
==============

Skyperious is a Skype database viewer and merger, written in Python.

You can open Skype SQLite databases and look at their contents:

- search across all messages and contacts
- browse chat history and export as HTML or spreadsheet, see chat statistics
- import contacts from a CSV file to your Skype contacts
- view any database table and export their data, fix database corruption
- change, add or delete data in any table
- execute direct SQL queries
and
- synchronize messages in two Skype databases: keep chat history up-to-date on
  different computers, or restore missing messages from older files into the
  current one

Additionally, it doubles as a useful database tool for any SQLite file.
Also, a [command line interface](http://suurjaak.github.io/Skyperious/help.html#commandline)
is available with key functions like exporting, searching, and merging.
The graphical version includes a Python console window.

Making a backup of the database file is recommended before making any changes.
There is an easy "Save as" button for that on the database index page.

Using The Program
-----------------

Skyperious can look through user directories and detect Skype databases
automatically, or you can select specific files or folders.
Once added to the database list, a file can be opened for browsing, searching 
and exporting, or compared with another database for merging.

Searching an opened database supports a simple Google-like
[query syntax](http://suurjaak.github.io/Skyperious/help.html).
You can use keywords to search among specific authors or chats only
(`from:john`, `chat:links`), or from certain dates only 
(`date:2012`, `date:2010..2013-06`). Search supports 
wildcards, exact phrases, grouping, excluding, and either-or queries.

HTML export can download shared photos and embed them in the resulting HTML.
This can be disabled in File -> Advanced Options -> SharedImageAutoDownload.  
As shared photos are kept on the web, Skyperious needs to ask for Skype account
password on HTML export. The password is only used for retrieving the images,
and is not retained.  
Image download is also supported in the command-line interface.

In database comparison, you can scan one database for messages not found in
the other, and merge all detected messages to the other database. Or you can
browse and copy specific chats and contacts.

Skyperious offers a number of options from the
[command line](http://suurjaak.github.io/Skyperious/help.html#commandline):
```
  export FILE [-t format]    export Skype databases as HTML, text or spreadsheet
  search "query" FILE        search Skype databases for messages or data
  merge FILE1 FILE2          merge two or more Skype databases into a new database
  diff FILE1 FILE2           compare chat history in two Skype databases
  gui [FILE]                 launch Skyperious graphical program (default option)
```

Skyperious can be minimized to tray, clicking the tray icon opens 
a search popup.

Skyperious can usually read from the same file Skype is currently using, although
this can cause temporary program errors. Writing to such a file is ill-advised.

The program itself is stand-alone, can work from any directory, and does not 
need additional installation, Windows installers have been provided for 
convenience. The installed program can be copied to a USB stick and used
elsewhere, same goes for the source code. The command line interface only needs
Python to run.

Skyperious has been tested under Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP and
Ubuntu Linux, and reported to work under OS X and Windows 8. In source code
form, it should run wherever Python and the required Python packages are
installed.

If running from pip installation, run `skyperious` from the command-line. 
If running from straight source code, launch `skyperious.sh` where shell 
scripts are supported, or launch `skyperious.bat` under Windows, or open 
a terminal and run `python skyperious/main.py` in Skyperious directory.

If you encounter a bug in the Skyperious GUI, you can send a report from menu
Help -> Send feedback.


Installation
------------

Windows: download and launch the latest setup from
http://suurjaak.github.io/Skyperious/downloads.html.

Mac/Linux/other: install Python, wxPython, pip, and run
`pip install skyperious`

The pip installation will add the `skyperious` command to path.
For more thorough instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Skyperious has a Vagrantfile, see
[dist/README for Vagrant.md](dist/README for Vagrant.md).


Source Dependencies
-------------------

If running from source code, Skyperious needs Python 2.7 or 2.6,
and the following 3rd-party Python packages:
* wxPython 2.9+ (http://wxpython.org/)
The following are also listed in `requirements.txt` for pip:
* pyparsing (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/)
* XlsxWriter (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/XlsxWriter)
* Pillow (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow)
* dateutil (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil)
* BeautifulSoup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
* Skype4Py (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Skype4Py)

If wxPython is not available, the command line interface will function
regardless.
If other Python libraries are not available, the program will function 
regardless, only with lesser service - like lacking Excel export or full 
search syntax.

Skyperious can also run under wxPython 2.8.12+, with some layout quirks.
Python 2.6 will need the argparse library. Python 3 is yet unsupported.
